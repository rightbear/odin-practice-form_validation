This is practice of "Form Validation with JavaScript" in The Odin Project

(2025/06/21) I complete this practice with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as module, eventListener and validity to customize the validation rules for a simple form. I add function like validating format of e-mail, postal-code and password. I also add a confirmation field to check the password again. The validation result of form fields will displayed under the fields immediately. Finally, I use ESLint and Prettier to format my code. This activity strengthens my skills in HTML form and JavaScript.
